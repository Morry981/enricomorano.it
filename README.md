## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
        └── stories/
            └── [id].astro
        └── users/
            └── [id].astro
│       └── [...stories].astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. Because the list of stories and users is always changing, dynamic routes like `[id].astro` are used to build pages when a specific page is requested.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Server-side rendering (SSR)

This project uses the [`@astrojs/node`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) adapter to deploy the SSR site to Node targets. Check out Astro's [deployment docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for details on other adapters and hosting environments.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
